"""
Turns results/raw.jsonl into a flat CSV and the plots of the benchmark campaign.

Repeats are aggregated, never overwritten: every curve goes through a median, and the spread
across repeats is kept for the error bars. Runs that failed or hit the timeout stay in the CSV
with status "failed", and runs disturbed by the machine (see flag_disturbed) with "disturbed".

Needs only matplotlib, not ROOT, so it runs on a laptop over a results directory copied off the
cluster.

    The thesis's scalability table (tab:scalability) for one benchmark of the strong sweep.

    Same definitions as the hand-written original, so a new campaign drops in unchanged: loop is
    the event-loop wall time under ImplicitMT(n), speedup and efficiency are against
    ImplicitMT(1), and throughput is events over that loop time. Total is the whole process
    (total_seconds), what a user waits for, so the fixed cost of opening the files and compiling
    the kernels stays visible next to the part that parallelises. Cores busy is the event loop's
    own CPU time over its wall time, the same window as the time column, so it is directly
    comparable to the thread count. The whole-process CPU figure is deliberately not shown: it
    also counts the single-threaded setup and JIT, so on 1 TB it reads ~48 s against a ~43 s
    loop at 48 threads, less than half of what the loop actually used. Returns None when the
    sweep has no records for this test.

    Rows are limited to TABLE_THREADS (environment, space-separated) plus the fastest point,
    so a dense sweep around the maximum does not turn the table into twenty lines.
