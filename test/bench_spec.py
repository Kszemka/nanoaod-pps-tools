What the benchmarks compute, without ROOT: the chains, their columns and cuts, and the rule
that turns --input into a list of files.

bench_common re-exports all of it, so the benchmarks keep using bc.<name>. It lives apart for
the worker processes of bench_pool.py: an uproot worker that imported ROOT only to learn the
chain would carry ~0.3 GB it never uses, 192 times over, and charge it to uproot.

# The detector-dependent parameters of the chain, per data-taking period. "2026" is the
# notebook's analysis on examples/test.root (run 396727) and the ds_xN copies of it: pots
# 23|123 and 3|103, diamond timing detectors, RP 22. In 2016 PPS ran with strip detectors only,
# in pots 2, 3, 102 and 103, so there the 2026 chain rejects every event at double_arm. The
# 2016 variant keeps the same five steps over the same columns with that year's pots and
# detector type. Its index cuts cannot be the 2026 ones either: every strip track belongs to a
# single-RP proton, so "single_rp_idx == -1" drops every event; it keeps the multi-RP cut and
# turns the single-RP one around.
#
# "run3" is the 2024-2026 data set: in its files (e.g. run 401844) the diamonds hold tracks in
# under 0.5% of events and multi-RP protons in 3%, so every cut that needs either drops almost
# all of it. The chain there selects on the pixels (rpType 4, RP 23), and its two index cuts are
# turned around: a track not used by a multi-RP proton, a track used by a single-RP one.
#
# track_x and track_y are the same, loose, in every period: some track with x > 4 mm and some
# with y > 0 mm. On examples/test.root with the run3 cuts they pass 99.0% and 99.7% of the
# events that reach them and the whole chain keeps 52.5%; strip tracks in 2016 have y around 0,
# so there y > 0 drops about half.
